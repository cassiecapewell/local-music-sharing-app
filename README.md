# Local Music Sharing Web App
I am a hip hop writer in Boston, and am often brainstorming ways to help local music fans discover (and support) local artists who are making music they'd love... and just don't know yet. This web app shares curated playlists of local hip hop based on vibe ("chill" or "funky," for example). Users can select the vibe they want, and enjoy a custom playlist of local music that fits the selected mood. The app also featured local DJ sets, and will eventually share events and shows in Boston.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB
(also currently setting up Spotify authentication)


I am only just getting started, and I am looking forward to continually optimizing this passion project. Thanks for checking it out! Feel free to hit me up if you want to discuss any part of this web application.
